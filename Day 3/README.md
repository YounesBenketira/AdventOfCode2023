# Part 1 Solution

Firstly I iterated through the input file and stored all symbols found in a hashmap (implemented in hashmap.c),
then I iterated through the input file again to determine whether a number met the requirements to be added to the sum.

I prefer simplicity over efficiency especially when it comes to non-critical software, which is why I decided to iterate twice through the input file instead of implementing a complex way to do it all in one iteration with comparable efficiency. The time complexity of this solution is O(2n) or O(n)
